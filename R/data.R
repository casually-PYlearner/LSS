#' A fitted LSS model on street protest in Russia
#'
#' This model was trained on a Russian media coprus (newspapers, TV transcripts
#' and newswires) to analyze framing of street protests. The scale is protests
#' as "freedom of expression" (high) vs "social disorder" (low). Although some
#' slots are missing in this object (because the model was imported from the
#' original Python implementation), it allows you to scale texts using
#' \code{predict}.
